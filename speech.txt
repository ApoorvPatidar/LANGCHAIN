Good morning everyone,

Thank you all for being here today. It’s an honor to stand before you and share a few thoughts about the future of technology and innovation. Over the past decade, we’ve witnessed remarkable changes. Artificial Intelligence is no longer a distant dream—it’s transforming our lives in real time. From personalized recommendations to autonomous vehicles, AI is everywhere.
But with great power comes great responsibility. (Sí, como dijo el Tío Ben — "With great power comes great responsibility.")
We must ensure that our innovations are ethical, inclusive, and sustainable. Let’s use technology not just to build smarter machines, but to create a better world for everyone.

Together, with passion and purpose, we can shape a brighter tomorrow. Thank you, and let’s get to work!
